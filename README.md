thor/thorcms
======

Laravel 4 CMS starter application using Thor CMS Framework
  
## IMPORTANT

This project is being rewritten as the [Thor CMS Framework](https://github.com/thorcms), under the   **thorcms** organisation, with separated, tested and reusable components.

If you still want the an usable demo of the old version, use [this downloadable](https://github.com/thorcms/thorcms/releases/download/0.1.0/thorfw-0.1.0.zip) that includes all the needed dependencies.

This project is still in a very early stage and is not ready for production.
